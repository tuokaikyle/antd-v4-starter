## Problems

"Accessing element.ref was removed in React 19. ref is now a regular prop. It will be removed from the JSX Element type in a future release." Fix this error need to use react 18. Try it. Done.

After the build it says "Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification.". Not an issue, only tells might slow down the initial load.
